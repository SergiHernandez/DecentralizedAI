# Decentralized AI
This repository has been created by students from *Universitat Pompeu Fabra* with the intention of studying and exploring solutions to decentralize AI models using Blockchain technologies so that anyone could afford to train an AI model and so that anyone could own a stake in them if they wish. 
We propose a consensus protocol that uses Deep Learning model training as Proof of Useful Work and a solution with Smart Contracts in Ethereum. We finally study their weaknesses and costs and propose an alternative solution using Layer-2 applications.

## The paper
In SolutionsForDecentralizedAI.pdf you can find the paper of our work containing an introduction, our contribution, the background, terminology and definitions as well as an explanation of the embedding decentralized AI in the consensus protocol. Moreover, our initial coding steps are also explained in the paper. 

## The code
